Management of chronic pain is one of our strengths at Core Health & Wellness.

Massage therapy, in particular myofascial release and trigger point therapy can rapidly reduce and in some cases eliminate pain.  Trigger points are responsible for many chronic pain conditions, and massage therapy is probably the best way to treat them (scroll down to see more information about this).

Chronic pain conditions are associated with neurological wind-up otherwise called sensitization.  Massage therapy is useful for this, but a more comprehensive approach is needed.  At Core Health & Wellness we work with breathing, relaxation training, wellness coaching, and mindfulness.  An approach will be developed in consultation with you which suits your unique needs.

Dave is currently involved in a research project investigating the efficacy of these methods with Fibromyalgia (a chronic pain condition).



**More on trigger points and pain**

Trigger points (a.k.a. muscle knots) are points of extreme contraction within muscle fibres.  They produce moderate to extreme pain often in the area of the trigger point, but also often in other locations in the body.  The image below shows some of the trigger points which commonly cause tension headaches.  Other conditions which are commonly associated with trigger points include back pain, neck and shoulder pain, forearm overuse.  In fact chronic pain anywhere in the body is likely to involve trigger points to some degree. Effective trigger point treatment relies on the practitioner's ability to locate the point very specifically with their sense of touch, making massage therapists ideal for the job.
